Writing code using text editors will remain primary means communication with machines, until we don't figure out brain to machine linking.
Software engineers, writers spend a great deal of time on text editors to make magic happen. Thus it is important to improve the efficiency of information transfer between the brain and the machine.

In this post I will advocate Vim, Emacs as Text editor with superpowers and try to answer why spending time learning these archaic yet modern tools is worth the investment.

## 40 years is a long time
Vim, and Emacs have stood the test of time and would continue to do so for several more decades. These tools would assist you throughout your career.

## Gain new perspective
These tool would you a new way at looking at user interface, solving problems. Mac OSX support Emacs keybindings in every single text box, websites like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit support Vim's j/k navigation keys. Using these tools would open lot opportunities to do everyday task more efficiently.

## Focusing on problem
The most important aspect of learning these tools is - once you earn the muscle memory these tools get out of your way. Then your brain can focus deeply on the problem and let muscle memory deal with the typing.

## Conclusion
Pick a tool either Vim, Emacs (I recommend Vim for beginners, start with vimtutor) and enjoy the compounding benefits these tools have to offer. Feel free to connect with me to discuss more on these topic.
